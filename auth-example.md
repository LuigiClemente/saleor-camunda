1. Consul Setup:
   - Install and set up Consul on the Keycloak server using the Docker Compose repo.
   - Configure Consul to run in server mode and ensure that it is accessible from both the Keycloak server and the Saleor server. 
   - Set up Consul agents on both the Keycloak server and the Saleor server. These agents will communicate with the Consul server for service registration and discovery.

2. Keycloak Configuration:
   - In the Keycloak configuration file (e.g., `keycloak.json` or `application.properties`), update the `frontendUrl` and `backendUrl` settings to use the Consul service name instead of the private IP address or hostname.
   - For example:
     ```
     "frontendUrl": "http://keycloak.service.consul:8080/auth",
     "backendUrl": "http://keycloak.service.consul:8080/auth"
     ```
   - Configure the Keycloak Docker Compose file to register the Keycloak service with Consul. Add the following configuration to the Keycloak service:
     ```yaml
     labels:
       - "consul.enable=true"
       - "consul.service.name=keycloak"
       - "consul.service.port=8080"
       - "consul.service.check.http=/auth/realms/master"
       - "consul.service.check.interval=10s"
     ```
   - This configuration registers the Keycloak service with Consul, specifies the service name, port, and health check details.

3. Saleor Configuration:
   - In Saleor's configuration, update the Keycloak-related settings to use the Consul service name instead of the private IP address or hostname.
   - For example, if an application uses the Keycloak JavaScript adapter, update the `keycloak.json` file:
     ```json
     {
       "realm": "your-realm",
       "auth-server-url": "http://keycloak.service.consul:8080/auth",
       "ssl-required": "external",
       "resource": "your-client-id",
       "public-client": true
     }
     ```
   - Similarly, update any other Keycloak-related configuration in of any application to use the Consul service name.

4. Service Registration:
   - On the application server, create a Consul service definition file (e.g., `app-service.json`) that describes your application service:
     ```json
     {
       "service": {
         "name": "myapp",
         "port": 8000,
         "check": {
           "http": "http://localhost:8000/health",
           "interval": "10s"
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - This file defines the service name, port, and health check details for your application.
   - Register the application service with Consul by running the following command:
     ```
     consul services register app-service.json
     ```

5. Service Discovery:
   - When an application needs to communicate with Keycloak, it will use the Consul service name (`keycloak.service.consul`) instead of the private IP address or hostname.
   - The Consul agent on the application server will resolve the service name to the actual IP address and port of the Keycloak service registered with Consul.
   - Similarly, when Keycloak needs to communicate with your application, it will use the Consul service name (`myapp.service.consul`) instead of the private IP address or hostname.

6. APISIX Configuration:
   - Configure APISIX to route external requests to your application using the Consul service name.
   - In your APISIX configuration, define an upstream that points to the Consul service name of your application (`myapp.service.consul`).
   - Create a route in APISIX that maps the external URL to the upstream defined in the previous step.

With this setup, the communication flow would work as follows:

1. An external client sends a request to APISIX.
2. APISIX routes the request to your application based on the defined route and upstream, using the Consul service name.
3. The Consul agent on the application server resolves the service name to the actual IP address and port of your application.
4. Your application receives the request and authenticates/authorizes it using Keycloak.
5. The application sends a request to the Keycloak server using the Consul service name (`keycloak.service.consul`).
6. The Consul agent on the application server resolves the Keycloak service name to the actual IP address and port of the Keycloak service.
7. Keycloak processes the request and sends the response back to your application.
8. Your application processes the response and sends the appropriate response back to APISIX.
9. APISIX forwards the response to the external client.

Using Consul for service discovery and configuration management, you can easily connect our Keycloak instance with the Saleor in a private network without relying on hard-coded IP addresses or hostnames. Consul takes care of dynamically resolving the service names to the actual IP addresses and ports, providing flexibility and scalability to your setup.
